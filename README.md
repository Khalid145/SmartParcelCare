Smart Parcel Care is a way of keeping track of parcels based on a variety of measurements. 

Customers and Businesses can monitor the location, temperature , water level and orientation of their parcels. You can also monitor whether the parcel has experienced any kind of force.

The Smart Parcel Care will be placed inside the parcel and adhesive will be applied so that the Smart Parcel Care is firmly attached to the side of the parcel. The Smart Parcel Care will consist of five sensors; GPS, Temperature and Humidity, Water Level, Orientation and Impact Detection. The data will then be sent from the Smart Parcel Care to the cloud where the data will be processed and display on a webpage for customers to view.
